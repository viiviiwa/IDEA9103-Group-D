<b>AI Utilisation Disclosure</b>
<br>In completing this assessment, our group used AI tools such as ChatGPT and Grammarly to support the development process. ChatGPT assisted us in exploring, comparing, and breaking down possible coding approaches based on our initial concepts. Its use was intentionally limited to the scope of IDEA9103’s taught lessons to ensure all derived code remained aligned with our existing skills, knowledge, and coursework framework, with only minimal flexibility for techniques outside the syllabus. Grammarly was used solely to refine our writing by reducing redundancy and improving clarity and conciseness.
